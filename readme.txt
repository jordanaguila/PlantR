To run this program you need to have an environment set up on your pc that allows servlet applications to run I recommend Tomcat 10 https://tomcat.apache.org

1. Once tomcat is installed navigate to its install folder 

2. In the install folder there will be a folder called webapps

3. Once in the web apps folder create a directory called PlantR

4. Copy all the files from the GitHub into the PlantR directory 

5. Now start tomcat and open the web browser of you choice

6. Now navigate to localhost:(your port)/PlantR (By default your port will be 8080 unless changed)

7. The app is now up and running so enjoy.
